The command handler that handles incoming commands. 

Within the Kernel, this function is called, which in return runs an endless loop to continuosly ask the user for commands. To begin, the function sys\+\_\+req(\+R\+E\+A\+D,\+D\+E\+F\+A\+U\+L\+T\+\_\+\+D\+E\+V\+I\+C\+E,buffer,\&size) is called that sends the process to \mbox{\hyperlink{serial_8c_ab1d1d36bd91339352f5b66f809b34d8c}{polling()}}, in which the buffer is filled with the commands the user types in. Commhand() uses strtok() found in String.\+h to split the buffer into \char`\"{}tokens\char`\"{}, each being a word separated by a space. The first token is then compared through a series of if-\/else if statements to determine the appropriate action to perform.
