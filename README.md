# project: Creating a simple Operating System
A trivial OS is simulated using C language that mimics how processes are managed and executed. The OS is interacted with by the user using the console, where the input is stored in a buffer to be processed internally within the code. Based on what the command the user provided, the OS performs the correct operation. Because it is a trivial Operating System, it is only able to process user commands, set up alarms using the internal clock, and allocate/deallocate memory from the limited heap of memory. The allocation and deallocation of memory depicts how processes are managed by the OS, where they reside in priority queues of ready, busy, and blocked processes. The OS was initially created to work by continuously waiting for user inputs or “busy waiting”, and was later upgraded to work on processes and never wait for user input. Instead, all user inputs, such as keystrokes, would trigger interrupts that allow the internal buffer to store whatever the user is typing. This ensures that the OS keeps working on completing processes while the user has not provided any new inputs.
